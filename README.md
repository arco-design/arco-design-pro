## ðŸ”¥ Multi-architecture solution

In essence, a Pro project is a set of project templates. The common pro project templates on the market generally have a fixed selection and structure, so that if users want to modify the structure themselves, the cost will be relatively high.

Therefore, the Arco Pro v2 version has designed a set of multi-architecture solutions that can output pro templates of multiple architectures on the basis of maximizing code reuse.
